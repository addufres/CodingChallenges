# Coding Challenges
This repository is a collection of coding challenges that I have done over the last year that I am finally getting around to uploading from various sites around the internet into an ide and putting them into Java classes. I want to have a neat and concise collection of everything I have accomplished and done.
This will be added to on a regular basis this is just the first couple to get it started like fizzbuzz and crap like that.
